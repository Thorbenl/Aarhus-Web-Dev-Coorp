A project in the Umbraco CMS.

## Getting Started

Open the Project in Visual Studio. Look into the App_data folder and make sure you delete the .log file.
Then make sure to change the connection string to SQLEXPRESSXX. 
XX is the number you have to check yourself. The server instance of sqlexpress should be running of course.

### Prerequisites

Make sure to use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio v. 17.5 and install the latest SQL version.
